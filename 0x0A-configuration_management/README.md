1. Introduction to Puppet
Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool used for deploying, configuring, and managing servers. It allows system administrators to define the desired state of their infrastructure using code.

2. Puppet Components
Puppet Master
The Puppet Master is the central server that manages Puppet agents.
It stores Puppet code and configurations and compiles configurations for distribution to agents.
Puppet Agent
Puppet agents are nodes or servers that run the Puppet software.
They connect to the Puppet Master to retrieve configurations and apply them to their systems.
3. Puppet Manifests
Manifests
Manifests are files written in Puppet's domain-specific language (DSL).
They contain the desired state of resources that Puppet should manage on a system.
4. Resources
Resources
Resources are the basic building blocks of Puppet manifests.
They represent system components such as files, packages, services, and users.
5. Classes
Classes
Classes are reusable blocks of Puppet code that define configurations for specific tasks or components.
They help organize and modularize Puppet code.
6. Modules
Modules
Modules are collections of related Puppet code, including manifests, classes, templates, and files.
They allow for better organization and sharing of Puppet code.
7. Facts
Facts
Facts are variables that store information about the system, such as hardware details, network settings, and operating system.
Puppet agents collect facts about their systems and send them to the Puppet Master for use in configuration.
8. Puppet Apply vs. Puppet Agent
Puppet Apply
Puppet Apply is a command-line tool used to apply Puppet manifests locally on a system.
It is often used for testing configurations on a single node without a Puppet Master.
Puppet Agent
Puppet Agent is a service running on nodes that connects to the Puppet Master to retrieve and apply configurations.
It runs as a daemon process and periodically checks in with the Puppet Master for updates.
## Conclusion
This README provides a foundational understanding of Puppet concepts and terminology. By mastering these concepts, you can effectively use Puppet to automate and manage your infrastructure.
