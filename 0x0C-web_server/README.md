# Web Server and Nginx
## Introduction
This repository provides an introduction to web servers and the Nginx web server specifically. Whether you're new to web development or looking to understand how web servers work, this README aims to provide a clear explanation.

### What is a Web Server?
A web server is software that delivers web content (such as web pages, images, videos, etc.) to clients over the internet. It uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with clients, such as web browsers.

### Key Functions of a Web Server:
Hosting Websites: A web server hosts website files and serves them to users when they request them.
Processing Requests: It handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and responds with the appropriate content.
Handling Protocols: Web servers support various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc.
Managing Connections: It manages connections with clients, ensuring efficient communication.
What is Nginx?
Nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a popular open-source web server software known for its high performance, stability, and scalability. Originally created to solve the "C10k problem" (handling 10,000+ simultaneous connections), Nginx has become one of the most widely used web servers worldwide.

### Key Features of Nginx:
Reverse Proxy: Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to other servers and then returning the response to clients. This is useful for load balancing and caching.
Load Balancing: Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
HTTP Server: Nginx serves static content quickly and efficiently, reducing latency for users.
TLS/SSL Termination: Nginx can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this task from application servers.
Virtual Hosting: Nginx supports virtual hosting, allowing multiple websites to be hosted on the same server.
