### Introduction
SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two devices over an insecure network. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by encrypting the traffic.

### Key Generation
SSH uses cryptographic keys for authentication. Key pairs consist of a public key (which is shared with remote servers) and a private key (which you keep secure on your local machine). To generate SSH keys:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Use the ssh-keygen command to generate a new SSH key pair.
Follow the prompts to specify the key file location and passphrase (optional).
Once you have generated your SSH key pair, you can use it to authenticate with remote servers securely.

### Connecting to a Remote Server
To connect to a remote server using SSH:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Use the ssh command followed by the username and hostname of the remote server.
If prompted, enter your passphrase to unlock your private key.
For example:

bash
Copy code
ssh username@hostname
Replace username with your username on the remote server and hostname with the server's hostname or IP address.
